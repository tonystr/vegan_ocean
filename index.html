                    The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14" target="_blank">United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #14</a>, or UNSDG14 for short, is an international goal to preserve life below water. Although you've probably heard about how <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/09/24/plastic-pollution-affects-sea-life-throughout-the-ocean" target="_blank">plastic is killing sea life</a>, we're contributing to their decimation by eating them too. Let's stop relying on ending lives to pleasure our taste buds, and focus on delicious foods from plants instead!
